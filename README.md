First React Experience

This is my first attempt in learning how to use React along with a Bootstrap template.

Technologies used:
- React 
- Bootstrap 4
- Babel 6

index001 - bootstrap template
index002 - created the React components
index003 - added props and propTypes to the components
index004 - looking at adding states for multiple layouts
