# 000-react-bootstrap-components
First React Experience

This is my first attempt in learning how to use React along with a Bootstrap template.

Technologies used:
- React 
- Bootstrap 4
- Babel 6

- index001 - bootstrap template
- index002 - created the React components
- index003 - added props and propTypes to the components
- index004 - looking at adding states for multiple layouts

We will take markup from the Bootstrap Navbar and Jumbotron template and repurpose them into React components complete with props and states.

Lessons Learned:
- Setup simple React components.
- How to use props and propTypes.
- How to use states.
- A look into lifecycle methods.
